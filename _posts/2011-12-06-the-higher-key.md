There are things that only you can do, and you are alive to do them. In the great orchestra we call life,
you have an instrument and a  song, and you owe it to God to play them both sublimely.
But  there is a canyon of difference between doing your best to glorify God and doing whatever it takes to glorify
yourself. The quest of excellence is a mark of maturity. The quest for power is childish.

-Max Lucado
