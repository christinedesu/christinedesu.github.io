description: Some of my notes and highlights while reading Frank Chimero's "The Shape of Design"

---


I’ve been reading Frank Chimero's “The Shape of Design” and I feel so moved by the first few chapters of it. Some of his thoughts are an eye-opener for a student like me that I’m pretty sure I’ll go back and keep on rereading every chapters of this book from now on.

 As of this post, I’ve read 37% percent of the book and so this will appear to be unfinished. I just want to highlight all of the things I’ve reflected upon at this point so that I can reread these again. Each notes will be separated in parts.



<strong> Part I. </strong>

I love how the author compared himself to a mocking jay during his moment of design block/ fruitfulness. He heard a mocking jay chirp, in its exact rendition of a car beep. And even though the technique is flawless and accurate, it sounded so horrible. It sounded annoying for the listeners but the mocking jay had no idea that its listeners feel that way. Most of all, the chirp had no identity. It had no soul because it’s merely just an imitation.

Based on some of the conversations I had with others, this is one of the most common problems that most designers make, and I'm not an exception.

Beauty is seductive. It’s luring. It’s captivating. For designers and artists, it may evoke jealousy if not careful.

As a beginner in the field of design, I remember looking at dribbble and being amazed at how polished and beautiful other design projects there are. It gave me a push to improve myself. But other than that, it also got me stuck into staring at them for a long time, wondering about those designers' techniques, and how can I implement them on my own works. I thought that since the things I'm seeing are the trends, and I have to keep up with the community.

I was stuck with the form and the idea to make my work feel like theirs. It led me to producing some decent design pieces with the closest attempt of replication to some of their techniques.

But now I realized that my designs lack purpose. They lack my voice and my creativity. My designs became just empty forms without purpose; a bad attempt of a noise that can be found anywhere. (Illustrations and designs that can be searched in google images to be exact.) I’ve realized that I’ve worked on the form but not so much on the purpose.

While technique is important, the purpose outweighs it at a much larger scale.

<strong> Part II. </strong>

Reading this part made me wonder how to deal with creative blockages. That if I were not to imitate, how will I be able to make something purposeful? How will I be able to create a master craft that is so meaningful? How will I find the motivation to do so?

He did then mentioned that “it’s difficult to conceive of nothing in the world that is too full” But we as humans were made to create, to tinker, and to change the world.

I then thought about one of the biggest reasons why I found my joy in design. It led me closer to the Maker. Just like how He longed to build, make things beautiful and better, so are us. It makes me grateful on how privileged we humans are to have such characteristics. However, it also led me into questioning what motivated Him to create such a beautiful world and to never stop helping His people to improve. I guess the answer is love.

We've heard so much about empathy and selflessness in design. But on top of those, to design something is to love. I can probably create thousands of works for myself and just be content of what they look because it’s for me and I can compromise however I want to.

But to build something for someone is a different story. It requires all the care and attention. It is the inspiration for the highest craft.

This will separate one’s work to another. Because love will remain intact and other people will feel the care and dedication that has been put to it. Love is the bond that hold things together. (As cheesy as this sounds)

"The work has enough love when enthusiasm transfers from the maker to the audience and bonds them."
