        <p>It was a Tuesday night, my dearest friends and I went to a Chinese restaurant for our last dinner together. I ate less than I usually do for I don’t want to have an upset stomach for the following day. It was followed by a sleep over at one of their houses, and was less than usual too. I woke up very early that day with heavy eyes, having only 3 hours of sleep, stepped out of the door of their house looking at their room’s window where they were standing and waving goodbye. It was sad and cold, colder than the winter breeze that added to such a gloomy atmosphere.</p>

<p>I sat on the window seat of the plane and tried my best to sleep. I know I need this for when I open my eyes, another day will come. Another new day.</p>

<p>With the crowd, loud noises, traffic, warm weather (very warm), and a snowless winter: California bid me hello. It actually felt good. I was happy. I went straight to In n’ Out to have a late lunch and be able to eat their very popular burgers (the only thing that used to pop out of my head each time I think about California). Needless to say, the only In n’ Out we have at Omaha is a car wash.</p>

<p>I registered very late for classes. Having been able to get some classes that I really want was just out of grace.</p>

<p>First day of school came. I had butterflies in my stomach. The fact that I’m going to start studying Design in Silicon Valley still feels like a dream.</p>

<p><em>“So don’t throw it all away now. You were sure of yourselves back then. It’s still a sure thing! But you need to stick it out, staying with God’s plan so you’ll be there for the promised completion.”
Hebrews 10:35-36</em></p>

<p>I tried to change my usual routine and decided to focus more on my studies. I spent a lot of my time alone in the library. Hard work is a goal, especially now that I feel like I have a lot to catch up on.</p>

<p>Everything in Silicon Valley seems overwhelmingly fast. The place is filled with a diverse group of smart and motivated people. Almost everyone I met have a specific goal which they are trying to reach. It feels great and exhilarating to be around with such people.</p>

<p>Besides my general education requirements, I’m also finally taking some basic design (and design history) classes. It’s a good start.</p>
