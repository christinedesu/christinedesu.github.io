        <p><em>First of all, I just want to quickly mention that Dan Norman’s “The Design of Everyday Things” has made a great impact  on me as a designer. Not only did it gave me a new vision and sensibility to all the things around me, it also influenced my decision in learning more about Psychology</em></p>

<hr />

<p>One of the topics on his books talk about the <strong>human cognition and emotion</strong> and that one way to understand how they work is to think of three different levels of processing that all work together in harmony.</p>

<p><strong>001 VISCERAL LEVEL</strong></p>

<p>The visceral level is the most basic level of processing. It’s the fight or flight reaction that we humans have and is what we used when making quick judgements. “The visceral system allows us to respond quickly and subconsciously, without awareness or control.” It’s very fast and almost automatic.</p>

<p><strong>designer takeaway:</strong> In design, this is where the aesthetics or style becomes very important. “It’s all about attraction or repulsion.” To drive these visceral responses successfully, one must design something beautiful enough that it will immediately attract. This is kind of like making “love at first sight” happen. (Sorry for the poor word choices)</p>

<p><strong>002 BEHAVIORAL LEVEL</strong></p>

<p>The behavioral level, according to Don Norman, is the “home of learned skills, triggered by situations that match the appropriate patterns.” Although the behavioral level invokes actions, these actions are still done subconsciously. Some of the good examples that he gave are daily basic movements like moving our hands, or arms. That even though we’re moving these body parts, we’re not really reflecting upon those movements. But with every actions, there’s always an expectation associated with it.</p>

<p><strong>designer takeaway:</strong> In design, this is where feedback matters. One must make sure that the information and knowledge of result is being communicated clearly.</p>

<p><strong>003 REFLECTIVE LEVEL</strong></p>

<p>This is where consciousness and deep understanding takes place. Unlike the first two, this one is “cognitive, deep, and slow.” It’s more of the thought one has after something took place. This is also where the highest level of emotions take place.</p>

<p><strong>designer takeaway:</strong> This is the most important thing for a designer to take into consideration. It’s where the “user experience” comes into place. What thought/ emotion will your design evoke after one has used it? Will it delight them through its ease of use? Or will it frustrate them and make them not want to use them again?</p>

<p>All these three levels work together and should all be considered when designing a product. It can’t be one greater than the other. For example, if one’s product just looks pretty on the outside but is barely functional, it will just create negative emotions from the people. At the same time, if a product is perfectly functional but is visually unattractive, people might not even try to use it on the first place.</p>
